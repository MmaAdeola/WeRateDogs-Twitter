# WeRateDogs-Twitter

This project was carried out as the second project in the ALX/Udacity data analysis nanodegree program.
It is the analysis of the tweet archive of the WeRateDogs (@dog_rates) acount. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. 
This project required data to be gathered using three different approaches and from three different sources. First dataset was downloaded manually and read into Jupyter notebook usind pandas read_csv. The second was downloaded programmatically from a url and the thrird dataset was obtained from the twitter API using Tweepy. 
The three datasets were assessed and cleaned individually before there were merged into a master dataset. This is to ensure data integrity.
Insights and visualizations were generated from the cleaned dataset.
